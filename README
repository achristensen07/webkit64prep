This is how I compile WebKit for x64 Windows.  I have the webkit repository copied to C:\cygwin\webkit,
the WinCairoDependencies repository copied to C:\cygwin\WinCairoDependencies, and this repository in C:\cygwin\webkit64prep
but this can probably be changed by changing the beginnings of the perl files and doing different registry changes as appropriate. 
These instructions assume webkit builds on your computer.

1) revert and clean (remove all unversioned files) WinCairoDependencies and webkit repositories
2) run perl scripts (webkit one twice - sometimes it doesn't work the first time)
3) compile WinCairo_vc8.sln twice (yes, twice) with Release x64 configuration
4) copy libs (don't forget libpng.lib) to webkit/WebKitLibraries/win/lib
5) compile WebKit.sln with Release_Cairo_CFLite x64 configuration
6) copy dlls from WinCairoDependencies/Bin to webkit/WebKitBuild/Release_Cairo_CFLite/bin overwriting any dlls (they're probably 32 bit dlls)
7) with regedit, add a new key at "Computer/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Apple Computer, Inc./Safari" with a new string value named InstallDir with value data "C:\cygwin\webkit\WebKitBuild\Release_Cairo_CFLite\bin" (without the quotes)
8) with regedit, add a new key at "Computer/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Apple Inc./Apple Application Support" with a new string value named InstallDir with value data "C:\cygwin\webkit\WebKitBuild\Release_Cairo_CFLite\bin" (without the quotes)
9) run WinLauncher
